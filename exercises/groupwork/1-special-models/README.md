# 1 Special models

We discussed some modeling rules, like 

* symmetric modeling (synchronize exclusive and parallel gateways)
* don't mix events and activities after gateways
* better do not use the complex gateway
* ...

But, what happens if we model it nevertheless?

Tasks:
* model examples for edge cases 
* check how the process engine handles these
* be creative!

Hints:
* write JUnit tests for the different models
* maybe create some quiz for your follow students what the outcome of the process instances for the different models might be
* your Java code should follow the default coding guidelines from https://www.sonarlint.org/
