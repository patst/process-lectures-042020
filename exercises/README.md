# Camunda BPM exercises

This repository contains exercises for different components of BPMN in the Camunda BPMN engine on the one hand 
and exercises to implement the car dealership process from the business engineering lecture.

## Project layout

The `delegates` directory contains a simple project where a Java Delegate must be implemented.
This is a good start to test if the development environment is working.

The `cardealership` folder contains exercises to implement the business engineering car dealership process

## Runtime environment

For implementing and building the exercises this is needed:

* Development environment, e.g.
    * [Eclipse for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers)
    * [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
* [Java 11 JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) 

Maven is used as dependency management framework. Maven can be bootstrapped and executed using the maven wrapper:

```
./mwnw install
```

Apart from the command line Eclipse has an own Maven installation which is working as well.

The project can be imported in any Java IDE with Maven support and should be working.

## Running the application

All examples are Spring-Boot applications.

They can be run using `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.

The cockpit is then accessible at http://localhost:8080 (Username: admin/ Password: admin).
